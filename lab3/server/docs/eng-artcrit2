Why even bring up Greenberg, one may ask?  Wasn't Pop Art and all that came after a successful coup de grace to Greenberg and his theories?   To Greenberg, yes.  To his theories, no.  Art theory since Greenberg, as Greenberg himself maintained, has been nothing but an embarrassment to everyone but the truly credulous.  Greenberg's theories on aesthetics were false, deluded, and self-important; but at least he took the subject seriously, compared to his successors.  He tried, with misguided valor, to restore the dwindling importance of art, if only in order to reflect on his own importance.  He could not see that art's dwindling importance was due, in large part, to the influence of previous criticism, and that criticism could not possibly save it.  But despite this, subsequent theories did not conquer Greenberg's, they simply set themselves up in the void left by his theories.

 

Greenberg paved the way, unintentionally, for the possibility of Pop Art and the other nihilistic eruptions since, and maybe this should be punishment enough.  But I will not leave him be.  His undercurrents of historicism and dialectical materialism have been refuted by the movement of art history since 1960, but much of his theory still stands untouched, and remains as a strong influence even today.  Art was not moving in the direction he thought it was, even as he was trying to determine that direction, but his theories have helped determine, in a sense, what is critically viable in the last half-century.  His success called the present demons out of the closet.
